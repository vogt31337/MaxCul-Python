# About MaxCul for Python

This Module is forked from this Project https://github.com/jokey2k/MoritzServer.
It can communicate over a serial connection and a cul stick with MAX! Devices build by eQ-3 http://www.eq-3.de/produkte/max.html.

The CUL (or CC1101 USB Lite) is a USB Stick, which sends and receive Packages in the 868Mhz frequency.
The FHEM community developed a open firmeware for the stick and so the MAX! protocol ist only one of many protocols you can use with this stick.
I build my own stick with this instruction: https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/Selbstbau_CUL
But you can buy it for example here: http://www.busware.de/tiki-index.php?page=CUL

To install the dependecys use this command.
```
python setup.py install
```

After that you can start a test server with this command.
```
python bin/moritz-server.py --cul-path /dev/ttyUSB0
```

This open a small webserver with some tools to control your devices and see there states.
